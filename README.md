PhysBuzz
========

A surrealist sonic shooter (first-person, physics-based) interpreting an Andalusian dog's Sisyphean solution to the tried-and-true programming puzzle.

To build: clone this repo, build scene_main.unity in Unity, and open the resulting program while running `chuck Sound/init.ck`.

Made in Unity3D and ChucK as a final project for Stanford University's *Physics-Based Sound Synthesis for Games and Interactive Systems* course.
